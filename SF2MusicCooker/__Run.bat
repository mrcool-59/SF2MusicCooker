rem --- Advanced users: POSTBUILD script ----
rem -----------------------------------------

rem You can create a "POSTBUILD.bat" file in the tool folder that will run whenever the tool successfully executes.
rem This script is only invoked if the tool wrote the output files to the SF2DISASM folder, first argument is the path to the SF2DISASM folder.
rem A typical use of POSTBUILD script is to invoke "buildstandard-test.bat" and start an emulator.
rem You can use "POSTBUILD_Example.bat" as a template to write your own "POSTBUILD.bat" script.
